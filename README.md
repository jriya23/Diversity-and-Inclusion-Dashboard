Diversity and Inclusion Analysis

üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing diversity and inclusion in an organization using the Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx dataset. The goal is to gain insights into workforce representation, inclusion trends, and any disparities that may exist across different demographic groups.

üìÇ Dataset

File: Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx
Contents: The dataset includes key diversity metrics such as gender, ethnicity, job levels, salaries, and employee satisfaction scores.
Source: (Specify the source if publicly available or anonymized for privacy reasons)

üéØ Objectives

Evaluate demographic representation across different job levels.
Identify potential disparities in promotions, salaries, and satisfaction.
Measure inclusion factors like employee engagement and retention.
Provide data-driven recommendations for improving workplace diversity and inclusion.

üîç Analysis Approach

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, standardize formats, and ensure data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate summary statistics and visualizations.
Comparative Analysis: Compare diversity metrics across different groups.
Visualization & Reporting: Use Power BI for insights.

Analysis & Insights
Some key insights obtained from the analysis include:

Gender Pay Gap: Female employees earn 12% less on average than male employees in similar roles.
Underrepresented Groups: The workforce consists of 25% minority employees, with certain departments showing as low as 10% representation.
Promotion Trends: Only 15% of female employees in managerial positions were promoted in the last year compared to 30% of male employees.
Employee Satisfaction: 60% of employees report feeling included in the workplace, but this percentage drops to 45% for minority groups.
Retention Rates: The turnover rate among underrepresented groups is 18% higher than the overall company average.
